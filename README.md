# ALSA Mixer Frontend for RME Babyface Pro (FS)

I am not the author of this project. This project is still quite useful if you want to use RME Babyface Pro FS with Linux at this time (11/18/2023 as I write this). Follow these steps to get rid of all troubles.

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt install libasound2-dev
sudo make
```

Then you are all set!
